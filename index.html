                        <p class="center">Online food ordering is the process of ordering food, for delivery or pickup, from a website or other application. The product can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen, restaurant, or a virtual restaurant) or food that has not been specially prepared for direct consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, fruits, frozen meats. etc).Online food ordering systems are a great option for restaurants looking to respond to a rapidly changing operating environment and most are relatively easy to set up.</p>
